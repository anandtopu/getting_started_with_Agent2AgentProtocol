# 04-22: Choose a binding with the official client

Maplewood is upgrading its client boundary. Discover first, then configure the SDK client with the provided authenticated transport.

Implement async exercise(http, brief, previous). The supplied client is in-process and carries the appropriate fixture credentials unless this is an authorization attack. Read the original brief dynamically: the grader varies guest counts. Return the result described below.

## Acceptance criteria

Discover first, then configure the SDK client with the provided authenticated transport. The grader performs actual SDK requests, checks resulting state, and rejects the starter. It uses no network or API keys. Read [the trusted acceptance contract](../../../../gym/boundary_checks.py) for the exact return shape; do not edit it.

## Spec

[A2A normative operations and types](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/blob/v1.0.1/specification/a2a.proto).

Run uv run gym start 04-22, then uv run gym check 04-22.
